# Forwarding HTTP/S Proxy

A forwarding HTTP/S proxy. This server is useful when one wants to have
originating requests to a destination service from a set of well-known IPs.


## Usage

```
$ forwardingproxy -h
Usage of forwardingproxy:
  -addr string
    	Server address
  -cert string
    	Filepath to certificate
  -clientreadtimeout duration
    	Client read timeout (default 5s)
  -clientwritetimeout duration
    	Client write timeout (default 5s)
  -destdialtimeout duration
    	Destination dial timeout (default 10s)
  -destreadtimeout duration
    	Destination read timeout (default 5s)
  -destwritetimeout duration
    	Destination write timeout (default 5s)
  -key string
    	Filepath to private key
  -lecachedir string
        Cache directory for certificates (default "/tmp")
  -letsencrypt
        Use letsencrypt for https
  -lewhitelist string
        Hostname to whitelist for letsencrypt
  -pass string
    	Server authentication password
  -serveridletimeout duration
    	Server idle timeout (default 30s)
  -serverreadheadertimeout duration
    	Server read header timeout (default 30s)
  -serverreadtimeout duration
    	Server read timeout (default 30s)
  -serverwritetimeout duration
    	Server write timeout (default 30s)
  -user string
    	Server authentication username
  -verbose
    	Set log level to DEBUG
```

To start the proxy as HTTP server, just run:

```
$ forwardingproxy
```

To start the proxy as HTTPS server, just provide server certificate and private
key files:

```
$ forwardingproxy -cert cert.pem -key key.pem
```

To create a self-signed certificate and private key for testing, run:

```
$ openssl req -newkey rsa:2048 -nodes -keyout key.pem -new -x509 -sha256 -days 3650 -out cert.pem

```

Or enable letsencrypt

```
$ forwardingproxy -letsencrypt -lewhitelist proxy.somehostname.tld -lecachedir /home/somewhere/.forwardingproxycache
```

The server can be configured to run on a specific interface and port (`-addr`),
be protected via `PROXY-AUTHORIZATION` (`-user` and `-pass`). Additionally, most
timeouts can be customized.

To enable verbose logging output, use `-verbose` flag.


## Implementation details

It is a simple HTTPS tunneling proxy that starts a Go HTTPS server at a given
port awaiting `CONNECT` requests, basically dropping everything else. To start
the HTTPS server one has to provide a server certificate and private key for the
TLS handshake phase.

Once a client requests a `CONNECT` it will create a TCP connection to the
provided destination host, and on successfully establishing this connection,
hijack the original client connection, and transparently and bidirectionally
copying incoming and outgoing TCP byte streams.

It has minimal logging using Uber's Zap logger.


## Features

This is NIH (_Not Invented Here_ syndrome), thus quality and feature set is not
en-par with hosted or off-the-shelf solutions.

Compared to especially hosted solutions, insight into the proxies operations
such as logging, monitoring, usage statistics need to be added if desired.
Additionally, one has to setup the binary as a reliable server and automate
deployments.


## Background

If one has a third-party requirement to have server requests originating from a
fixed IP address, there are mainly two options: (i) host code on a cloud
provider such as an EC2 instance and connect the instance to an EIP (Elastic
IP). (ii) But if code is hosted on a PaaS provider with no guarantee of a fixed
IP, such as Heroku, one would proxy requests through a proxy server and have
that proxy server attached to a fixed IP.


### Proxy

To proxy HTTPS requests, one broadly has two options in software: Use the [HTTP
Tunnel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_tunnel) feature via the
[CONNECT](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2817.txt) method, also called a
[Forwarding Proxy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proxy_server), or a [Reverse
Proxy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse_proxy). There are hardware
solutions on OSI layer 3 instead of layer 7, namely a NAT proxy, but this is not
discussed here as it more convenient nowadays to not require access to physical
hardware or want to invest into a NAT proxy e.g. on AWS.


#### Forwarding Proxy

A forwarding proxy can come in two flavours:

One in which the proxy terminates an incoming client request, evaluates it, and
forwards the request to a destination. This works for HTTP as well as for HTTPS.
A subtle but important side-effect of using a forwarding proxy for HTTPS is that
it would terminate the request, thus being able to inspect the request's content
(and modify it).

The other in which the proxy uses tunneling via the `CONNECT` method. By this, a
proxy accepts an initial CONNECT request entailing the entire URL as `HOST`
value, rather than just the host address. The proxy then opens up a TCP
connection to the destination and transparently forwards the raw communication
from the client to the destination. This comes with the subtle difference that
only the initial `CONNECT` request from the client to the proxy is terminated
and can be analyzed, however, any further communication is not terminated nor
intercepted thus SSL communication can't be read by the proxy.

One additional subtle thing to mention is that forwarding proxies using
tunneling rely on clients to understand and comply to the HTTP tunneling RFC
2817 and thus have to be explicitly configured to use HTTP/S proxying, usually
picking up the proxy url from environment variables such as `HTTP_PROXY` and
`HTTPS_PROXY` respectively. For Go, see
[net/http/Transport](https://golang.org/pkg/net/http/#Transport) and


#### Reverse Proxy

A reverse proxy accepts incoming requests from clients and routes them to a
specific destination based on the request. Discriminators for destination could
be the host, path, query parameters, any header even the body. A reverse proxy,
in any case, intercepts and terminates the HTTP and HTTPS connections and
creates new requests to the destinations.


## Alternatives

One can consider alternatives in protocol and product, as well as _Make vs Buy_.

Alternatives to a forwarding proxy would be a reverse proxy or NAT proxy.
Reverse proxies as outlined above would require more routing logic. A NAT proxy
would require more network or hardware configuration even if it's abstracted by
IaaS providers.

Alternative products would be [Squid](http://squid-cache.org),
[NGINX](https://www.nginx.com), [HAProxy](http://haproxy.org),
[Varnish](http://varnish-cache.org), [TinyProxy](https://tinyproxy.github.io),
etc. NGINX is primarily meant to be used as a reverse proxy and can be difficult
to set up acting as a forwarding proxy. HAProxy is similar to NGINX meant to be
used as reverse proxy as well as HTTP cache. Varnish is primarily meant to be
used as HTTP cache. Squid and TinyProxy are closest to be working as forwarding
proxies, however it can be difficult to set them up on a new Amazon Linux 2 AMI
EC2 instance, and TinyProxy is not maintained anymore since several years.

Alternatives to _Make vs Buy_ would be:

Heroku's [Private Spaces](https://www.heroku.com/private-spaces) feature stable
outbound IPs:

>**Stable outbound IPs**
>
>Securely connect apps to third party cloud services and corporate networks.

This would weight in with a price tag of either $1000 or $3000 respectively for
GDPR compliance.

Another _Make vs Buy_ alternative would be hosted Heroku's Add-ons that would
offer stable IP support such as
[Fixie](https://elements.heroku.com/addons/fixie),
[Guru301](https://elements.heroku.com/addons/guru301),
[Proximo](https://elements.heroku.com/addons/proximo), [QuotaGuard
Static](https://elements.heroku.com/addons/quotaguardstatic),

_Fixie_ and _Guru301_ only support Heroku's _United States_ region, not Europe.
_QuotaGuard Static_ and _Proximo_ both support Heroku's _Europe_ region and
would offer 20,000 respectively 50,000 requests per month for $19 respectively
$25 per month.
